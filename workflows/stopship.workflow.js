// Live acceptance on DeepSeek Flash and GLM-5-Turbo measured the inherited
// read-only prompt/tool envelope at 17,457 and 17,550 tokens before the first
// useful tool turn completed. Budget 24k per intended evidence turn, then add
// token-neutral max_steps headroom for the required final verdict. The token
// ceiling remains independent and the five role caps still total 360k.

Response 3 must return the verdict with no tool calls. Any later reserved response must also return the verdict without tools instead of gathering more evidence. Do not follow definitions outside File scope. A concrete call site, typed event constructor, or exact test assertion in a scoped file counts as source-owner evidence. If any required evidence is still missing or ambiguous after response 2, return BLOCK instead of searching again. The first non-empty line of your response must be exactly APPROVE or exactly BLOCK. Do not put any words before that verdict: no confirmation, summary, heading, or phrase such as `Here is the verdict`. Use APPROVE only when the evidence covers the stopship alias, named Fleet loading, role-to-profile resolution, tmux Lane launch, typed task_started, gate_updated, and terminal run_completed receipts.
