# Tool surface

Why these specific tools, in this groupings, and how each one is meant to be
chosen over the available shell equivalent. Companion to `crates/tui/src/prompts/agent.txt`.

## Design stance

- **Dedicated tools over `exec_shell` whenever the dedicated tool returns
  structured output.** Bash escaping is error-prone and platform behavior
  varies (GNU vs BSD `grep`, `rg` is not always installed). Structured
  output also frees the model from re-parsing free-form text.
- **`exec_shell` for everything else.** Build, test, format, lint, ad-hoc
  commands, anything platform-specific. We don't try to wrap the long tail.
- **Drop tools that don't beat their shell equivalent.** Two-tool aliases
  for the same backing operation are a model trap — the LLM will alternate
  between them and the cache hit rate suffers.

## Current surface (v0.8.49)

### File operations

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read a UTF-8 file. PDFs auto-extracted via bundled pure-Rust extractor (no Poppler install required); `pages: "1-5"` slices large docs. |
| `list_dir` | Structured, gitignore-aware listing. Preferred over `exec_shell("ls")`. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file. |
| `edit_file` | Search-and-replace inside a single file. Cheaper than a full rewrite. |
| `apply_patch` | Apply a unified diff. The right tool for multi-hunk edits. |
| `retrieve_tool_result` | Read summaries or slices of prior large tool outputs spilled to `~/.codewhale/tool_outputs/`; use `summary`, `head`, `tail`, `lines`, or `query` instead of replaying the whole result. |
| `handle_read` | Read bounded projections from `var_handle` payloads held by live tool environments. This is the foundation for RLM sessions, sub-agent transcripts, and other large symbolic payloads. |

### Search

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `grep_files` | Regex search file contents within the workspace; structured matches + context lines. Pure-Rust (`regex` crate), no `rg`/`grep` shell-out. |
| `file_search` | Fuzzy-match filenames (not contents). Use when you know roughly the name. |
| `web_search` | DuckDuckGo by default with Bing fallback; Bing, Tavily, Bocha, Metaso, SearXNG, Baidu, Volcengine, and Sofya are selectable in config. Ranked snippets + `ref_id` for citation. |
| `fetch_url` | Direct HTTP GET on a known URL. Faster than `web_search` when the link is already known. HTML stripped to text by default. |

### Shell

Shell tools appear in the model-visible tool catalog only when shell access is
enabled for the active session or profile. Interactive TUI Agent sessions expose
shell by default with approval prompts unless top-level `allow_shell = false`
hides it. Headless, durable-task, and other noninteractive profiles keep the
conservative omitted-field default and require `allow_shell = true`. YOLO
enables shell access automatically. Plan mode keeps shell execution off.

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `exec_shell` | Run a shell command. Foreground runs are cancellable, but use them only for bounded commands; timeout kills the process and returns a background-rerun hint. |
| `exec_shell_wait` | Poll a background task for incremental output. Canceling the turn stops waiting without killing the task. |
| `exec_shell_interact` | Send stdin to a running background task and read incremental output. |
| `exec_shell_cancel` | Cancel one running background shell task by id, or all running background shell tasks when explicitly requested. |
| `task_shell_start` | Start a long-running command in the background and return immediately. Preferred over foreground shell for diagnostics, tests, searches, and servers that may run for minutes. |
| `task_shell_wait` | Poll a background command. If `gate` is supplied after completion, record structured gate evidence on the active durable task. |

`allow_shell = true` exposes shell tools; it does not disable built-in shell
safety validation. Direct multiline `exec_shell` commands, including heredocs
and embedded scripts such as multiline `python -c`, are blocked. Use one-line
commands, write the script/content to a file first and execute it, or start
long/manual flows with `task_shell_start` or background shell and poll them.

When a foreground shell command times out, the process is not continued
silently. The tool result tells the model to rerun long work with
`task_shell_start` or `exec_shell` with `background = true`, then poll with
`task_shell_wait` or `exec_shell_wait`.

Interactive shell jobs are also visible through `/jobs`. The TUI job center is
fed by the same shell manager as `exec_shell`/`task_shell_start`, and shows the
command, cwd, elapsed time, status, output tail, process-local shell id, and
linked durable task id when available. `/jobs show`, `/jobs poll`, `/jobs wait`,
`/jobs stdin`, and `/jobs cancel` provide inspect, polling, stdin, and cancel
controls for live jobs. Jobs are process-local; after restart, live process
state is not reattached, and any remembered detached entries must be marked
stale rather than presented as live processes.

Shell permission policy is evaluated by `crates/execpolicy`. Deny prefixes are
checked before trusted prefixes and block matching commands regardless of layer.
Trusted prefixes only skip approval in modes that permit trust shortcuts.
Manually authored `permissions.toml` records support
`action = "deny" | "ask" | "allow"`: `deny` blocks matching invocations before
mode-based approval handling, `allow` skips approval for matching invocations,
and `ask` forces approval only in modes that can prompt. Outside the TUI
auto-approve path, a matching `ask` rule under `AskForApproval::Never` is
rejected because the runtime cannot ask the user. In YOLO / auto-approval
sessions, `ask` rules do not downgrade the session into prompting or blocking;
explicit `deny` rules still block according to the current execution-policy
logic.

The TUI runtime loads typed records from the sibling `permissions.toml` file and
applies matching `exec_shell` command rules and explicit file-path rules. In
supported approval cards, `S` approves once and appends persistent
`action = "ask"` rules:

- `exec_shell`: the exact approved command string (matched by the existing
  arity-aware command matcher).
- `write_file`: the exact workspace-relative target path.
- `edit_file`: the exact workspace-relative target path.
- `apply_patch`: one exact workspace-relative path rule per validated touched
  file reported by apply-patch preflight.

`read_file` path rules can be authored in `permissions.toml` and matched at
runtime, but the approval UI does not save `read_file` rules. This is still not
a policy editor: the UI does not save `allow`/`deny`, edit or delete rules,
expand globs, or create broad directory rules.

### MCP manager and palette discovery

MCP server configuration is surfaced in the TUI through `/mcp` and the
`mcp_config_path` row in `/config`. `/mcp` shows the resolved config path,
server enabled/disabled state, transport, command or URL, timeouts, connection
errors, and discovered tools/resources/prompts. It supports narrow manager
actions for init, add, enable, disable, remove, validate, and reload/reconnect.
Config edits are written immediately, but the model-visible MCP tool pool is
restart-required after edits.

The command palette includes MCP entries grouped by server. Disabled and failed
servers stay visible, and discovered tools/prompts use the runtime names shown
to the model, such as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.

### Git / diagnostics / testing

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `git_status` | Inspect repo status without running shell. |
| `git_diff` | Inspect working-tree or staged diffs. |
| `diagnostics` | Workspace, git, sandbox, and toolchain info in one call. |
| `run_tests` | `cargo test` with optional args. |
| `run_verifiers` | Run independent verifier gates in parallel across detected Rust, Node, Python, and Go projects, with optional custom `program` + `args` gates for other ecosystems. |

### Task management and durable work

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `update_plan` | Optional high-level Strategy metadata/context/route for complex multi-phase work — not a second checklist. |
| `task_create` | Create/enqueue a durable background task through `TaskManager`. This is the real executable work object for long-running agent work. |
| `task_list` | List durable tasks with status and linked runtime ids. |
| `task_read` | Read durable task detail: thread/turn linkage, timeline, checklist, gates, artifacts, PR attempts, GitHub events. |
| `task_cancel` | Cancel a queued or running durable task. Approval-required. |
| `work_update` | Canonical To-do / Work progress under the active thread/task. Ordinary in-flight progress flows through this tool. |
| `note` | One-off important fact for later. |

The legacy `checklist_write` / `checklist_add` / `checklist_update` /
`checklist_list` and older `todo_write` / `todo_add` / `todo_update` /
`todo_list` names are hidden compatibility aliases for saved transcript
replay. They remain callable by exact name, but they are not part of the
model-visible catalog (#4132).

`update_plan` accepts both the legacy shape (`explanation` plus `plan` steps)
and a richer PlanArtifact shape for Plan mode review. The richer fields are
optional and should be filled only when grounded in evidence: `title`,
`objective`, `context_summary`, `sources_used`, `critical_files`,
`constraints`, `recommended_approach`, `verification_plan`,
`risks_and_unknowns`, and `handoff_packet`. The transcript card, Plan-mode
confirmation prompt, `/relay`, and fork-state handoff all render the same
artifact so a plan can be reviewed, accepted, revised, replayed, or delegated
without losing its source context.

Strategy metadata and checklist work are one Work surface. Treat
`update_plan` as phase context and sequencing intent, while `checklist_*`
remains the counted task ledger. When both exist, UI projections should group
strategy around the checklist instead of showing two peer checklist/progress
systems for the same run.

### Verification gates and artifacts

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `task_gate_run` | Run an approved verification command and attach structured evidence to the active durable task: command, cwd, exit code, duration, classification, summary, and log artifact. |

Large logs and command outputs should be artifacts with compact summaries in the transcript. `task_gate_run` handles this automatically for active durable tasks.

Sub-agent runs expose a compact run receipt through `agent`: `run_id`,
`follow_up`, `takeover`, `artifacts`, `usage`, `verification`, and
`worker_record`. Usage is marked
`unknown` until worker-level token accounting is available, and verification is
`self_report_only` unless a separate gate or artifact proves the claim.

### GitHub context and guarded writes

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `github_issue_context` | Read-only issue context via `gh issue view`; large bodies become task artifacts when possible. |
| `github_pr_context` | Read-only PR context via `gh pr view`; optional diff capture via `gh pr diff --patch`; large bodies/diffs become task artifacts when possible. |
| `github_comment` | Approval-required issue/PR comment with structured evidence. |
| `github_close_issue` | Approval-required issue closure. Requires non-empty acceptance criteria and evidence; refuses dirty worktrees unless explicitly allowed. Never use for PRs. |
| `github_close_pr` | Approval-required PR closure. Requires the same structured evidence as issue closure and keeps PR wording in tool output/audit records. |

### PR attempts

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `pr_attempt_record` | Capture the current git diff as attempt metadata plus a patch artifact on a durable task. |
| `pr_attempt_list` | List attempts recorded on a task. |
| `pr_attempt_read` | Inspect one recorded attempt and its artifact reference. |
| `pr_attempt_preflight` | Run `git apply --check` against an attempt patch. No worktree mutation. |

### Automations

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `automation_create` | Create a scheduled automation. Approval-required. |
| `automation_list` / `automation_read` | Inspect durable automations and recent runs. |
| `automation_update` | Update prompt, schedule, cwds, or status. Approval-required. |
| `automation_pause` / `automation_resume` / `automation_delete` | Lifecycle controls. Approval-required. |
| `automation_run` | Run an automation now; the run enqueues a normal durable task. Approval-required. |

### Sub-agents

v0.8.33 began moving large tool outputs toward symbolic handles: tools return
small `var_handle` objects, and `handle_read` retrieves bounded slices, counts,
or JSON projections from the backing environment. This keeps the parent
transcript small while preserving a recovery path to the full payload.

The active model-facing sub-agent surface is intentionally small:

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `agent` | Launch one focused child run. Returns an agent id, compact receipt, and transcript handle while the parent can keep coordinating. |

See `agent.txt` for the delegation protocol and
[`SUBAGENTS.md`](SUBAGENTS.md) for the role taxonomy
(`general` / `explore` / `plan` / `review` / `implementer` /
`verifier` / `custom`).

`agent` defaults to a fresh child conversation. Pass
`fork_context: true` for continuation-style work or multi-perspective reviews
that should inherit the parent's context. In fork mode, the runtime preserves
the parent prefill/prompt prefix byte-identically where available so DeepSeek's
prefix cache can be reused, then appends the child role instructions and task.

### Recursive LM sessions

RLM is now persistent as well:

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `rlm_session_objects` | List compact cards for the active prompt, session metadata, transcript, latest user message, and per-message refs. |
| `rlm_open` | Open a named Python REPL over a file, inline content, or URL. |
| `rlm_eval` | Run bounded Python against that session, using deterministic code and in-REPL semantic helpers such as `sub_query_batch`. |
| `rlm_configure` | Adjust output feedback, child-query timeout/depth, and session-sharing settings. |
| `rlm_close` | Shut down the Python runtime and return final session stats. |

`rlm_open` also accepts `session_object`, a stable ref returned by
`rlm_session_objects`, such as `session://active/system_prompt`,
`session://active/transcript`, or `session://active/messages/0`. This loads
the selected object into the RLM REPL and returns only metadata to the parent
transcript. Transcript objects keep thinking blocks and large tool results as
compact metadata; inspect large payloads through returned `var_handle` values
and `handle_read`, not by asking the parent transcript to paste the raw text.

Large RLM outputs should come back as `var_handle`s. Use `handle_read` for
bounded text slices, line ranges, counts, or JSONPath projections instead of
replaying the full value into the parent transcript.

Inside `rlm_eval`, the loaded source is available as `_context`; `_ctx` and
`content` are also bound as compatibility aliases because agents naturally
reach for them during Python analysis. The shorter `context` and `ctx` names
are intentionally not bound so user variables can use them without colliding
with the bootstrap.

Child-call timeouts are session policy: use `rlm_configure` with
`sub_query_timeout_secs` before running a large fan-out. The helpers
`sub_query`, `sub_query_batch`, `sub_query_map`, and `sub_rlm` accept a
`timeout_secs` keyword for compatibility with common agent guesses, but the
effective timeout remains configured at the RLM session level.

`finalize(value, confidence=...)` preserves JSON-serializable values. Strings
become text handles; dicts, lists, numbers, booleans, and null become JSON
handles that `handle_read` can project with JSONPath.

### Session relay

`/relay [focus]` asks the current agent to write `.deepseek/handoff.md` as a
compact `# Session relay` artifact for the next thread. The filename remains
for compatibility with existing prompt loading and older sessions; the visible
mental model is relay / 接力.

Aliases: `/batonpass`, `/接力`.

Use it before a long break, compaction, or moving work to a fresh session. The
relay should preserve the goal, current Work checklist item, changed files,
decisions, verification state, and one concrete next action.
Treat it as the deliberate counterpart to automatic compaction: both exist to
preserve continuity for the next session or sub-agent, but `/relay` lets the
current agent inspect live evidence and choose the durable handoff facts
explicitly. When `update_plan` has a rich PlanArtifact, `/relay` includes that
strategy metadata so manual relay, fork-state, and compacted continuity do not
drift into separate stories.

### Parallel fan-out: cost-class caps

Two tools offer parallel fan-out with different concurrency limits that
reflect very different cost classes:

| Tool | What each child does | Wall-clock | Token cost | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | Full sub-agent loop (planning, tool calls, multi-turn streaming) | minutes | thousands of tokens | 20 running by default (`[subagents].max_concurrent`, hard ceiling 20), with up to 200 running + queued admitted by default |
| `rlm_eval` helper `sub_query_batch` | One-shot non-streaming Chat Completions calls pinned to `deepseek-v4-flash` inside a live RLM session | seconds | ~hundreds of tokens | 16 per call |

The caps appear in each tool's description and error messages so the model
(and the user) can choose the right tool for the job. If one sub-agent is
enough but you need parallel semantic lookups over the same loaded context,
prefer `rlm_eval` with `sub_query_batch`; if each task needs its own
tool-carrying agent loop, use `agent` and inspect the returned transcript
handle when needed.

## Removed legacy aliases and surfaces

The old model-facing sub-agent fan-out surface is removed from active prompting
and tool catalogs. Do not use retired sub-agent lifecycle names in new active
guidance.

The old one-shot `rlm` model-facing tool is also replaced by persistent
`rlm_open` / `rlm_eval` / `rlm_configure` / `rlm_close` sessions.

v0.9.0 adds the following hidden-compat aliases (#2682, #2683):

| Hidden alias | Canonical replacement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `checklist_write` | `work_update` | Hidden, callable for replay (#4132) |
| `checklist_add` / `checklist_update` / `checklist_list` | `work_update` | Hidden, callable for replay |
| `todo_write` / `todo_add` / `todo_update` / `todo_list` | `work_update` | Hidden, callable for replay |
| `exec_wait` | `exec_shell_wait` | Hidden, callable for replay |
| `exec_interact` | `exec_shell_interact` | Hidden, callable for replay |

All hidden aliases remain registered and callable so saved transcripts can
replay without teaching new sessions the deprecated spelling.

## Release smoke: verify the live names

When validating a release, verify the model-visible registry names directly.
Do not grep random handler function names; handler names are allowed to drift
while the registry contract stays stable.

Version smoke:

```bash
codewhale --version
codewhale-tui --version
```

Tool-surface smoke:

```bash
rg -n '"handle_read"|"rlm_open"|"rlm_eval"|"rlm_configure"|"rlm_close"|"agent"' crates/tui/src
rg -n 'handle_read|rlm_open|rlm_eval|rlm_configure|rlm_close|agent' docs crates/tui/src/prompts crates/tui/src/tools
```

The canonical live names:

- `handle_read`
- `rlm_open`, `rlm_eval`, `rlm_configure`, `rlm_close`
- `agent`

The registry should not actively advertise retired sub-agent lifecycle names or
the old foreground `rlm` tool outside historical changelog entries.

## Additional registered tools (v0.8.49)

The category tables above cover the most commonly used tools. The full
registry also includes these model-visible tools:

| Tool | Niche |
|---|---|
| `web.run` | Browser-based web interaction (JavaScript-rendered pages, form filling) |
| `multi_tool_use.parallel` | Execute multiple independent tools in a single turn |
| `request_user_input` | Prompt the user for input mid-turn |
| `git_show` / `git_log` / `git_blame` | Inspect commit details, history, and line authorship |
| `load_skill` | Load a skill by id from the installed skill set |
| `revert_turn` | Roll back the workspace to a pre-turn snapshot |
| `pandoc_convert` | Convert between document formats via pandoc (gated by binary presence) |
| `validate_data` | Validate JSON or TOML against a schema |
| `code_execution` | Execute Python code in an isolated sandbox |
| `review` | Code review with structured feedback |
| `project_map` | Generate a structural map of the project workspace |
| `remember` | Store a persistent fact in user memory (gated by `memory_enabled`) |
| `image_analyze` | Vision-model image understanding (gated by `[vision_model]` config) |
| `image_ocr` | Extract text from images via local OCR |
| `finance` | Fetch market data and stock quotes |

MCP tools, plugin-provided tools, and feature-gated tools may also be
visible depending on runtime configuration. Use `codewhale tools list` or
the TUI `/tools` palette to inspect the active catalog.

## Why we don't ship a single `bash` tool

Single-`bash` agents (Claude Code's design) are powerful but hand the model
all the foot-guns of shell scripting: quoting, platform divergence,
side-effects from misread cwd, `cd` not persisting between calls, etc. Our
file tools are also significantly cheaper to render in the transcript
(structured JSON-shaped output collapses better than `ls -la` walls of text).

The model can always fall back to `exec_shell` when something is missing.
The dedicated tools just take the common 80% off the shell escape-hatch.
