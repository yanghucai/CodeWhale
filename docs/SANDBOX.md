# Sandbox threat model

Codewhale can launch shell commands proposed by a model. Approval policy,
workspace-aware tools, and an operating-system command wrapper are separate
controls: an approval is not a sandbox, and selecting `workspace-write` does
not prove that the current platform has an OS wrapper available.

This document describes only behavior wired into the command execution path.

## Platform overview

| Mechanism | Platform | Selection | What Codewhale reports |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) | macOS | Automatic when the runtime probe succeeds | `macos-seatbelt` |
| Bubblewrap (`/usr/bin/bwrap`) | Linux | `prefer_bwrap = true` and the file is executable | `linux-bwrap` |
| No OS wrapper | Linux without usable opt-in bwrap | Default | `none` |
| No OS wrapper | Windows | Current implementation | `none` |
| OpenSandbox-compatible service | Any supported host | `sandbox_backend = "opensandbox"` | External execution path |

The repository contains Landlock and seccomp implementation modules, plus a
future Windows helper contract. They are not wired into child-command launch
in v0.9.1, so Codewhale does not advertise them as active sandboxes. Detecting
a Landlock-capable kernel is not enough to claim that a command was restricted.

## macOS: Seatbelt

Codewhale probes `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` by running a minimal profile. When the
probe succeeds and the selected `SandboxPolicy` requests a sandbox, the child
command is wrapped with a generated Seatbelt profile.

The profile can provide:

- broad filesystem reads;
- writes limited by the selected policy, including the workspace and specific
  runtime/cache paths needed by supported tools;
- network access only when the policy enables it.

If the probe fails or `sandbox-exec` is unavailable, Codewhale reports no OS
sandbox and launches the command without a Seatbelt wrapper. It does not set a
Seatbelt marker on that fallback.

## Linux: opt-in bubblewrap

Linux command sandboxing is opt-in. Set the top-level configuration key:

```toml
prefer_bwrap = true
```

Codewhale selects bubblewrap only when `/usr/bin/bwrap` is a regular executable
file. The wrapper derives its mounts and network namespace from the resolved
`SandboxPolicy`:

```text
/usr/bin/bwrap \
  --unshare-all \
  [--share-net] \
  --ro-bind / / \
  --bind <writable-root> <writable-root> ... \
  --ro-bind <protected-descendant> <protected-descendant> ... \
  --chdir <cwd> \
  -- <program> <args>
```

That gives the child a read-only root view. For `workspace-write`, every safe,
existing policy root is mounted read-write: the working directory, configured
additional roots, `/tmp` and `TMPDIR` unless excluded, and verified Git
worktree metadata roots. Existing `.codewhale` and `.deepseek` descendants are
remounted read-only after their writable parent. Missing paths, non-directory
paths, and `/` are not promoted to writable mounts.

For `read-only`, there are no writable binds, so the working directory remains
inside the read-only root view. `--unshare-all` isolates the network namespace
by default. Codewhale adds `--share-net` only when the policy's
`network_access` is true. `danger-full-access` and `external-sandbox` bypass the
local wrapper entirely.

If the user does not opt in, or `/usr/bin/bwrap` is missing or non-executable,
Codewhale reports `none` and launches the command without a Linux OS wrapper.
There is no marker-only Landlock fallback.

Install bubblewrap separately when this opt-in fits the workflow:

- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install bubblewrap`
- Fedora: `dnf install bubblewrap`
- Arch: `pacman -S bubblewrap`

Codewhale does not vendor bubblewrap.

## Windows: no advertised OS sandbox

The Windows command path currently reports no OS sandbox. The source tree has
a future helper contract for Job Object process-tree cleanup, but it is not
wired into selection and must not be described as any of the following:

- read-only filesystem or workspace-write enforcement;
- network blocking;
- registry isolation;
- restricted-token or AppContainer isolation.

Windows host permissions and approval policy still apply, but they are not a
Codewhale OS command sandbox.

## Linux process hardening is not a command sandbox

At startup on Linux, Codewhale best-effort applies `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0`,
`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS=1`, and `RLIMIT_CORE=0` to its own process. Each failure is
logged and startup continues. These controls reduce process-inspection,
privilege-escalation, and core-dump risk; they do not create filesystem or
network isolation for a child command and are not listed as a sandbox backend.

## External OpenSandbox execution

When `sandbox_backend = "opensandbox"` is configured, shell execution is sent
to the configured OpenSandbox-compatible HTTP endpoint instead of starting a
local child. Codewhale validates the request/response contract, but isolation
guarantees belong to the configured service and its operator.

```toml
sandbox_backend = "opensandbox"
sandbox_url = "http://localhost:8080"
sandbox_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

`sandbox_backend = "none"` (or omitting the key) keeps local execution.

## Policies and fallbacks

The local `sandbox_mode` values are:

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write" # read-only | workspace-write | danger-full-access | external-sandbox
```

- `read-only` and `workspace-write` are enforced by Seatbelt or bubblewrap only
  when that wrapper is selected and available.
- `danger-full-access` deliberately bypasses the local OS wrapper.
- `external-sandbox` declares that execution is already externally isolated
  and bypasses a second local wrapper.
- When no wrapper is selected, the shell command runs without Codewhale OS
  isolation. Approval rules and workspace-aware native file tools remain
  separate controls.

Canonical environment overrides exist for `sandbox_mode` and the external
backend:

- `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_MODE`
- `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_BACKEND`
- `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_URL`
- `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_API_KEY`

There is no `CODEWHALE_PREFER_BWRAP` environment override; use the top-level
`prefer_bwrap` config key.

## Diagnostics and failure attribution

`codewhale setup --status`, `codewhale doctor`, `codewhale doctor --json`, and
the `diagnostics` tool report the locally available wrapper after applying the
resolved bubblewrap preference. An individual command can still bypass that
wrapper when its policy does not request sandboxing. On Linux, merely finding
a Landlock syscall or a bwrap source module does not make
`sandbox_available` true.

Denial attribution is intentionally conservative:

- Seatbelt uses its wrapper-specific denial patterns.
- Bubblewrap setup errors must be prefixed by `bwrap:`; a read-only-filesystem
  error from the bwrap filesystem view can also identify the boundary.
- A child command's generic `Permission denied` or `Operation not permitted`
  is not, by itself, proof that Codewhale's sandbox blocked it.
- Unsandboxed command failures are never labeled sandbox denials.

## Limitations

- Availability is checked before launch; the selected wrapper can still fail
  because of host policy, container restrictions, or a race after the probe.
- Bubblewrap ignores a configured writable root if it is missing, is not a
  directory, or canonicalizes to `/`; a path can also disappear between policy
  resolution and wrapper launch.
- Seatbelt profiles are generated at runtime and must be tested against the
  commands they are expected to support.
- No current local wrapper is advertised on Windows.
- An external sandbox backend is only as strong as its configured service.
- No sandbox protects against kernel vulnerabilities or all resource-exhaustion
  and side-channel attacks.
