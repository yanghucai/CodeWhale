# codewhale-web

Documentation and community site for [Codewhale](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale) — lives at **codewhale.net**.

Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind, deployed to Cloudflare Workers via [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare). Curated "Today's Dispatch" content is regenerated every 6 hours by a Cloudflare Cron Trigger that calls `deepseek-v4-flash` to summarise recent repo activity, and stored in Workers KV.

## Local dev

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the keys you have
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Env (mirrors `.env.example`):

| Variable                    | What                                                             | Required?            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`          | DeepSeek platform key (`sk-...`)                                 | only for the `/api/cron` tasks (summarization + community agent) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`              | Fine-grained PAT, public-repo read scope                         | optional (raises rate limit 60 → 5000 req/h) |
| `GITHUB_REPO`               | Defaults to `Hmbown/CodeWhale`                                   | optional             |
| `CRON_SECRET`               | Shared secret for manual `/api/cron` invocation                  | optional (Cloudflare cron triggers don't need it) |
| `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`            | Defaults to `deepseek-v4-flash`                                  | optional             |
| `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`         | Defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com`                           | optional             |
| `MAINTAINER_TOKEN`          | Admin panel auth; access `/admin?token=<value>`                  | only for `/admin`    |
| `MAINTAINER_GITHUB_PAT`     | PAT with `issues:write`, for posting comments via `/admin`       | only for `/admin` posting |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITEE_ENABLED` | Set to `1` once the Gitee mirror exists; blank hides Gitee links | optional             |

The site renders fine without any of them — `Today's Dispatch` falls back to a static editorial; the GitHub feed shows "feed not yet loaded".

## Deploy to Cloudflare

Ordinary pushes and pull requests run the web checks and production build, but
they do **not** deploy. The `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/web.yml` runs
only for a maintainer-triggered `workflow_dispatch` on `main`. Before approval,
record the exact 40-character `origin/main` SHA and trigger that ref:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rev-parse origin/main
gh workflow run web.yml --repo Hmbown/CodeWhale --ref main
```

The manual job records the pre-deploy source drift, builds the OpenNext bundle,
deploys only after the protected Cloudflare inputs pass, and then requires the
public `/api/facts` receipt to report the exact workflow SHA. A credential-free
local comparison is available without starting a deployment:

```bash
npm run compare:deployed-facts -- --expected-revision <exact-40-character-sha>
```

You already own `codewhale.net` on Cloudflare and have a Workers Paid plan. The deploy is two steps:

1. **Provision KV namespaces once:**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler kv namespace create CURATED_KV
   npx wrangler kv namespace create NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV
   ```

   Copy the printed `id` values into the matching `wrangler.jsonc` bindings
   (replace each `REPLACE_WITH_KV_ID`).

2. **Set secrets and deploy:**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
   npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN     # optional
   npx wrangler secret put CRON_SECRET      # optional, for manual /api/cron?task=curate hits

   npm run deploy                           # builds with OpenNext + uploads
   ```

3. **Point the domain:** in the Cloudflare dashboard, add a Worker route for `codewhale.net/*` → the deployed Worker, named `codewhale-web` (see `wrangler.jsonc`).

The first cron run happens within 6 hours; you can also kick it manually:

```bash
curl -H "x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET" "https://codewhale.net/api/cron?task=curate"
```

## What's where

Pages are bilingual: each `app/[locale]/` page renders both English and
Chinese from the same file, keyed by the `[locale]` segment (`en` / `zh`,
see `lib/i18n/config.ts`). Copy changes must update both locales.

## Facts pipeline

Mechanical facts (version, provider list, sandbox backends, crate names,
default model, Node engines) are never hand-written into pages:

1. **Build time** — `scripts/derive-facts.mjs` runs as `prebuild` (and before
   `npm run dev`), parses the parent repo (`Cargo.toml`, `crates/tui/src/config.rs`,
   `crates/tui/src/sandbox/mod.rs`, `npm/codewhale/package.json`) and writes
   `lib/facts.generated.ts`. Never edit that file by hand.
2. **Published release** — `data/latest-published-release.json` records the
   latest GitHub Release separately from the source candidate. Install commands
   use this published tag; they never turn the workspace version into a release
   before publication. The credential-free deployed-facts comparison checks the
   record against the public receipt.
3. **Runtime** — the `/api/cron?task=facts-drift` cron (`lib/facts-drift.ts`)
   resolves an exact `main` revision, derives every source fact from that SHA,
   and writes changes to `CURATED_KV` under `facts:current`. Pages accept that
   snapshot only when its source provenance is the same as or newer than the
   deployed build. Legacy, malformed, or older KV data cannot replace newer
   build facts; published-release metadata is resolved independently. Public
   fact pages revalidate their cached HTML every five minutes.

`/api/facts` exposes only public provenance and counts: deployed/resolved source
revision, version, provider count, tool count, selection reason, and latest
published release. It contains no environment values, tokens, or KV contents.

When a new `ApiProvider` variant lands in `crates/tui/src/config.rs`, it must
be added to the `labelMap` in **both** `scripts/derive-facts.mjs` and
`lib/facts-drift.ts` (or to the `EXCLUDED` set if deliberately hidden). Both
fail loudly on unmapped variants, so the build / cron will tell you.

## Visual direction

The public site is a documentation portal with a restrained underwater atmosphere. Content and navigation come first; ocean depth, currents, and the whale mark provide identity without turning every section into a themed card.

- **Palette**: cool paper and mist for reading surfaces, deep navy for terminal and community sections, muted current blue for links, and small gold/coral signals where status needs contrast.
- **Type**: Space Grotesk for headings, IBM Plex Sans for body copy, and JetBrains Mono for commands and compact interface labels.
- **Structure**: compact documentation rows, quiet hairline dividers, generous but bounded reading widths, and responsive layouts that remove chrome before content.

If you want to retune the palette, edit `:root` in `app/globals.css` and the `colors` block in `tailwind.config.ts`.
